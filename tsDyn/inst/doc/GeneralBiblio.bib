	with price rises occurring more frequently than price reductions
	(Domberger [1987]). Existing explanations of price rigidity and asymmetric
	pricing assume that firms incur "menu costs" when they adjust their
	prices. There is, however, little empirical evidence to substantiate
	this assumption. This paper provides an alternative explanation for
	price rigidity as well as asymmetric price adjustment in the absence
	of menu costs. In an infinitely repeated duopoly with incomplete
	information, it is demonstrated that depending on the degree of collusion
	and parameters, a variety of pricing behaviour emerge in equilibrium.},

	(TAR) models play a significant role in the empirical analysis of
	some economic theories. This article compares the powers of recently
	proposed unit root tests in three-regime TAR models using Monte Carlo
	experiments. The following results are obtained from the Monte Carlo
	simulations: Kapetanios and Shin's (2006) Wsup, Wave, and Wexp statistics,
	which degenerate with respect to the threshold parameters under the
	null hypothesis, have a better power in the three-regime TAR process
	with a relatively narrow band of a unit root process and a small
	sample, whereas their statistics do not perform well when the threshold
	and sample size increase; Bec et al.'s (2004, BBC) sup W and Park
	and Shintani's (2005) inf-t statistics and their restricted models,
	which do not degenerate with respect to the threshold parameters
	in the limit, perform poorly in the three-regime TAR process with
	a small threshold even when compared with the Dickey-Fuller test,
	whereas their statistics perform better in the case of a large threshold;
	sup W, inf-t, and their restricted models perform much better when
	the sample size and threshold increase and the outer regimes have
	a rapid convergence. In order to substantiate the use of our Monte
	Carlo results for some of the applied work, we apply these tests
	to the real exchange rates for many countries.},

  abstract = {The threshold autoregressive model is one of the nonlinear time series
	models available in the literature. It was first proposed by Tong
	(1978) and discussed in detail by Tong and Lim (1980) and Tong (1983).
	The major features of this class of models are limit cycles, amplitude
	dependent frequencies, and jump phenomena. Much of the original motivation
	of the model is concerned with limit cycles of a cyclical time series,
	and indeed the model is capable of producing asymmetric limit cycles.
	The threshold autoregressive model, however, has not received much
	attention in application. This is due to (a) the lack of a suitable
	modeling procedure and (b) the inability to identify the threshold
	variable and estimate the threshold values. The primary goal of this
	article, therefore, is to suggest a simple yet widely applicable
	model-building procedure for threshold autoregressive models. Based
	on some predictive residuals, a simple statistic is proposed to test
	for threshold nonlinearity and specify the threshold variable. Some
	supplementary graphic devices are then used to identify the number
	and locations of the potential thresholds. Finally, these statistics
	are used to build a threshold model. The test statistic and its properties
	are derived by simple linear regression. Its performance in the finite-sample
	case is evaluated by simulation and real-world data analysis. The
	statistic performs well as compared with an alternative test available
	in the literature. Further applications of threshold autoregressive
	models are also suggested, including handling heterogeneous time
	series and modeling random processes with periodic variances whose
	periodicity is not fixed. The latter phenomenon is commonly encountered
	in practice, especially in econometrics and biological sciences.},
